> - SCM_Marshal. 
>
> For touch-pad, cross platform ready. Rally your entrants for the nights events. Your lane marshall can browse events and heats. Displays entrants, their lane numbers and race times. Let your referee flag a heat as 'raced', scratch or disqualify entrants.

<br>


> - SCM_TimeKeeper.
>
> For touch-pad, cross platform ready. This application lets your timekeepers enter race-times for their assigned lane. It also shows the entrant name, timetobeat and personal best. Or set the roaming feature on. This enabled one Grand Timekeeper Official to collect each lane's time for each heat run. 

<br>

> - SCM_Nominate.
>
> For touch-pad, cross platform ready. Get your members to self-nominate for the 'nights' events. Kiosk style - swimmers enter their membership number and then nominate for the listed events. Set up a couple of tablets at the frount gate for quick event nomination.
