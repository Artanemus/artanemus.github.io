Since swimmers only get one shot at swimming that\n      particular event, they're matched with competitors of most similar speed.\n      This means that the fastest swimmers are placed together in the last\n      heats.\n    ","\n    ","\n      The fastest swimmers in a heat always swim in the middle lanes.

Instead, heat and lane\n      assignments will be determined at the meet. If the meet is deck seeding,\n      swimmers will check in at the meet.

This\n      is usually for meets that are more for fun. Alumni meets and parent races\n      often have deck seeding. Pre-seeding distance events can be problematic.\n      If 50 people sign up for the 1000m and only 20 show up for the race, then\n      many people will be swimming by themselves.
